## cram

Contains [Cram](https://github.com/brodie/cram/) based tests. [Cram](https://github.com/brodie/cram/) is a functional
testing framework for command line applications. [Cram](https://github.com/brodie/cram/) tests look like snippets of
interactive shell sessions. Cram runs each command and compares the command output in the test with the command's actual
output.

Tests in this directory should be run against device, usually over network via SSH connection.
